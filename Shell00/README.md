## 🔧 Technical Requirements

- External functions are not allowed.  
- Only bash commands or standard UNIX tools may be used.  
- Each exercise must run correctly in the 42 testing environment.

---

## 🧠 Notes and Tips

- Git is your best ally: commit and push frequently.  
- Some exercises allow slight variations in date and name formats (e.g., `XX` or year).  
- Scripts should be minimalist, safe, and functional.  
- Collaboration is allowed, but each solution must be individual and understood by the submitter.  
- Use `man` pages often (RTFM!).

---

## 🚀 How to Test the Exercises

Each exercise can be tested using the local terminal or the remote 42 environment. Make sure to check:

- Permissions (`ls -l`)  
- Expected behavior (`cat`, `diff`, `find`, etc.)  
- `tar` structure and contents
