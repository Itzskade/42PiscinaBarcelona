# 💡 Project C Piscine C08

This repository contains all the exercises for Project C Piscine C08, focused on working with structures, macros, headers, and dynamic arrays in the C language. All exercises have been successfully completed.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Design reusable and Norminette-compliant `.h` headers  
- Create and manage dynamic structures using pointers  
- Use macros to simplify common operations  
- Display complex data in a readable format  
- Follow Norminette conventions with the `-R CheckDefine` flag

| Exercise | Description                                                  | Directory | Deliverable File         |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| 00       | Basic function prototypes in `ft.h`                          | ex00/     | ft.h                      |
| 01       | Custom booleans and macros in `ft_boolean.h`                 | ex01/     | ft_boolean.h              |
| 02       | `ABS` macro that returns absolute value                      | ex02/     | ft_abs.h                  |
| 03       | `t_point` structure to represent coordinates                 | ex03/     | ft_point.h                |
| 04       | Convert array of strings into a table of structures          | ex04/     | ft_strs_to_tab.c          |
| 05       | Display elements of the generated structure table            | ex05/     | ft_show_tab.c             |

## 🔧 Compilation Instructions

Compile each exercise with:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror exXX/file.c -o program_name
```


---

## 🧪 Testing Tips

- Verify that headers are correctly included in your `main` files  
- Ensure dynamic memory is properly freed  
- Use valgrind to detect potential memory leaks  
- Test your macros with various values and edge cases  
- Check that console output matches the expected format exactly

---

## 📐 Style Guidelines

- Indent code using tabs instead of spaces  
- Use clear and descriptive names for functions and variables  
- Write modular, clean, and well-commented code  
- Pass Norminette without exceptions, using the `-R CheckDefine` flag where required

---

## 📌 Recommendations

- Make frequent commits to track your progress  
- Add comments explaining the use of macros and structures  
- Review documentation on headers, macros, and pointers  
- Use helper functions to keep your code organized
