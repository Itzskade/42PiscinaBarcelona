# 💡 Project C05

This repository contains the exercises for Project C05, focused on mathematical and recursive operations in the C language.

You’ll learn to implement functions like factorials, powers, sequences, and classic algorithms such as prime detection and combinatorial problem solving.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Implement factorial calculation both iteratively and recursively  
- Calculate integer powers using different approaches  
- Use recursion to generate the Fibonacci sequence and solve problems like the ten queens puzzle  
- Detect prime numbers and find the next prime  
- Demonstrate understanding of classic programming algorithms  
- Follow the 42 Norminette style guidelines

## 🔧 Compilation Instructions

Compile each exercise individually with:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror exXX/file.c -o program_name
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Tips

    - Test with edge cases, negative values, and special scenarios  
    
    - Validate factorials, powers, and roots using external calculators  
    
    - Try various indices for the Fibonacci sequence  
    
    - Check prime detection behavior with values like 0, 1, and large numbers

---

## 📐 Style Guidelines

    - Indent code using tabs instead of spaces  
    
    - Use coherent and descriptive variable names  
    
    - No external functions allowed, except `write` where permitted  
    
    - Code should be organized, clear, and recursion well-applied where required

---

## 📌 Recommendations

    - Make frequent commits and explain what changes  
    
    - Consult resources like `math.h` or classic algorithms to understand the logic behind each exercise  
    
    - Comment your code when using recursion to keep it clear 
    
    - Before submitting, ensure all inputs are properly handled
