## 💡 Project C07

This repository contains the exercises for Project C07, focused on dynamic memory manipulation using `malloc`, arrays, strings, and numeric conversions in the C language.

Through these exercises, you'll learn to work with pointers, manage memory, transform strings, and split text using custom separators.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Use `malloc` to allocate dynamic memory  
- Create and manipulate dynamic arrays of integers and strings  
- Reproduce the behavior of standard functions like `strdup`  
- Convert numeric bases through string transformations  
- Split strings using multiple custom separators  
- Follow the 42 Norminette style guidelines

| Exercise | Description                                        | Directory | Deliverable File            |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| 00       | Reproduce the behavior of `strdup`                 | ex00/     | ft_strdup.c                  |
| 01       | Return an array with values between min and max    | ex01/     | ft_range.c                   |
| 02       | Allocate and fill an int array between min and max | ex02/     | ft_ultimate_range.c          |
| 03       | Join strings separated by a custom separator       | ex03/     | ft_strjoin.c                 |
| 04       | Convert a string between numeric bases             | ex04/     | ft_convert_base.c            |
| 05       | Split a string using multiple separators           | ex05/     | ft_split.c                   |

## 🔧 Compilation Instructions

Compile each exercise individually with:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror exXX/file.c -o program_name
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Tips

    - Verify that memory is correctly allocated  
    - Use valgrind to ensure there are no memory leaks  
    - Test with different ranges, empty strings, and complex separators  
    - Compare results with the examples provided in the instructions

---

## 📐 Style Guidelines

    - Indent code using tabs instead of spaces  
    
    - Use coherent and descriptive names for functions and variables  
    
    - Code should be structured, readable, and well-documented  
    
    - Fully comply with Norminette without exceptions

---

## 📌 Recommendations

    - Make frequent commits to document your progress  
    
    - Comment especially on memory management  
    
    - Review documentation on numeric bases and string functions  
    
    - Use helper functions to divide responsibilities
